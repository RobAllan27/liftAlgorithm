This is some overview information for the package from Rob Allan - package at https://github.com/RobAllan27/RandomDataGenerator<br/>
<br/>
<b>RandomDataSource</b> is the core of the application and creates the sample data.
<br/>
Features<br/>
 * It has a set of Lists that hold lists of values of names - such as firstnames, lastnames, states etc.<br/>
  
 * The generic Email Suffixes are for gmail etc.<br/>
 
 * The company email suffices represent email address suffixes (after the @ symbol) for specific companies like lawnmowers.com.au is the suffix to
 * rob@lawnmowers.com.au<br/>
  
 * We have the Australian States and a list of cities in Australia - many of these are actually towns<br/>
  
 * The code uses String builders to reduce the number of string manipulations (immutable strings)<br/>
 
 * There are set of generated string values that are declared up front - these will be populated as the program proceeds.<br/>

 * The generateNewRandomPerson() method defines the fields being created and their order. It calls supporter methods such as generateRandomPhoneAndPostCodeNumbers or getEmailAddress to actually create the information.<br/>
<br/> 
These in turn call methods like generatePostCode, generateDomesticCode and generateMobileNumber to create specific values.
It may be that the embedded business rules within these needs extending / altering to create new field rules. <br/>
<br/>
<b>RandomDataRunner</b> is a simple class that allows the collator to be run.<br/>
<br/>
<b>RandomDataCollator</b> holds details of where the file is located that the data will be written to. <br/>
It also defines the number of iteration of data creation and therefore how many rows of data are created.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Company</b> - this is POJO that holds data that needs to be linked - in this case the company email address and website.<br/>
